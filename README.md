## Description

This Web App is a simple yet powerful tool that enables you to discover books based on your preferred genres.
By typing in your desired subject, you can access a complete collection of the titles matching your interests. Leveraging the Open Library API, the application provides you with essential book details, including titles, authors, brief descriptions, and the original covers.

Lil's Library Web App was created by a bookworm for other fellow readers seeking their next literary adventure!
